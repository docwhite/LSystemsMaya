LSystemsMaya
============

Basic L-System rewriting with geometric interpretation in Maya.

## Installation
First of all, if you are not familiarized with git and you don't know how the cloning stuff works, just keep it simple:
Download all this project as a ZIP file (button on right side of the screen). Then, once you have extracted all the contents on your Desktop or wherever you want..
* Uncompress the ZIP file you just downloaded
* Open `startScript.py` with Notepad or your favourite text editor
* Copy all the content from it.
* Paste it to the Script Editor in Maya
* Execute the code
* You will be asked to point the location where all the scripts are. You must point to the folder called `script` inside the uncompressed  folder in which you have uncompressed the ZIP file.
* The UI should be created, then you can click on "Instructions" in order to get started as soon as possible.

This method for including the pointed folder as a sys.path for maya to access the files has been adapted from Jared Auty's wonderful scripting project, which you can download here  http://bit.ly/1kDUXhj

## Usage
I built up the UI considering standard users. **There's a Help Line**, there's an **Instructions Button**, and so on, I recommend paying attention to them. What I could do is talk a little bit about L-Systems for those ones who don't know what
they are. I will attach a diagram that shows how all the modules are connected:

### What are L-Systems?
An L-system or is a parallel rewriting system and a type of formal grammar. An L-system consists of an alphabet of symbols that can be used to make strings, a collection of production rules that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols, an initial "axiom" string from which to begin construction, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. *(from Wikipedia)*

*My turn now...* L-Systems consist on rewriting over a string of characters considering a bunch of rules. For instance you can start with an initial word, for instance `F` (this is formally called **Axiom**), then you have some rewriting rules that tell to replace this `F` by something a little bit more complex, for instance let's says replace `F` with `XF`.

If you apply this rule for each character of the word you would get `XF`, right? Because you iterated over the initial word.
So what if we want to iterate again over this string we got? We could! Because we still have the rule `F --> XF`, so if we run the rewriting system first of all we would come across an `X`, mmm.. we don't have any specific rule for it... Well,
nevermind, keep going. Next character is `F`, cool we have a rule for it, it says that we have to replace it with `XF`, go on. *(We rewrite)* Now we get `XXF`.

We could carry on with this, we did 2 iterations over the string in this example, so the **Depth** would be two (now you know what the depth parameter in my script is). You could expand the rules, you could have some rules for `X` as well. We could even have another rule that said `F --> GG` that could live with the previous one `F --> XF`. *Wait, wait! If you have rules that react to the same character (formally called **predecessor**), how can you chose which one to apply?* It's simple, with **percentages**, with probability. And L-System which implements probability is called a Stochastic L-System.
That's cool, isn't it?

### How do they relate to plants? (Turtle)
So far you could be asking yourself, how does that match to plants? Well... Here the **Turtle Concept** plays such an important role. For those ones who don't know what the turtle paradigm is: imagine you were in the beach and you had a turtle which you could control (I don't know how, maybe mental power!).

For instance you could tell the turtle (let's call it Leonardo, he is a male turtle) to move forward. If Leonardo did that, he would leave a path with his tail in the sand, wouldn't he? You would be able to see his trail. Now you could keep yelling commands to him such as *turn right Leo!*, *turn left!*. This is great but our amazing Leonardo can even do more crazy stuff. Imagine you could tell him: **Leo, remember your current position, save it in your little turtle mind**, then, keep walking forward and turning and more stuff until... when at some point we tell him **go back to that position you saved without leaving trail, teleport yourself!**, then, keep doing other movements from the place I told you before to save in your mind. This concept is called **Pushing a state into the stack** (remembering, saving), and **Popping the state of the turtle** (going back to where we saved the state) // With this concept implemented we could leave trails in the sand that would look like a branching system.

So with that silly explanation I wanted to say that we could give a **meaning** to each character in an L-System generated string. For instance we could say `**F** is Move Forward`, `+ is Turn Left`, `- is Turn Right`... We are just building up a language for the turtle commands, we are giving meaning to a bunch of characters, we are giving them a **Geometrical Interpretation**. THIS IS THE ESSENCE, because L-Systems on their own they are nothing but text characters.

There are some conventions I will be using in this script. The turtle we talked about before it's two-dimensional, try to translate the concept to the third dimension. I don't know, imagine Leo equipped with some sort of jet-pack, being the trail he leaves the smoke emitted by the exhaust pipe... Oh... I am being too creative, pardon me. So bearing in mind that, I collected this grammar:

* `F`    Move forward
* `f`    Move forward
* `L`    Leaf
* `B`    Blossom
* `+`    Rotate +X (yaw right)
* `-`    Rotate -X (yaw left)
* `^`    Rotate +Y (roll right)
* `&`    Rotate -Y (roll left)
* `<`    Rotate +Z (pitch down)
* `>`    Rotate -Z (pitch up)
* `*`    Turtle rotates 180 (as it was facing backwards)
* `[`   Push current turtle state on the stack
* `]`    Pop the current turtle state from the stack

This way we can do complex things for instance having this grammar set:
* Axiom: `F`
* Production Rules: `F --> F[-F]F[+F]F`
* Depth: 3

Then we could say that each step or "F" is a segment of *Length* 2, *Radius* 0.5, and each rotation is done considering a Step *Angle* of 28... We can say as well, each time the turtle *pushes* his state, to slightly *decrease* the length or the radius. This is what I implemented in my script.

Furthermore I added some fancy features such as customizing the *colour for the branches, for the leaves, and blossoms*. And this is pretty much all. You can find all the procedures and modules documented in an **HTML file** inside the documentation folder. Follow the help tips, and instructions of my script, you might need to practise in order to understand better!

### Examples
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docwhite/LSystemsMaya/master/examples/example.png)
This is a quick generation using 3 different presets. It's more a general overview. Now I will comment some nice results I got. Major part of them are included in the preset buttons in the UI, try to mess around with them.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docwhite/LSystemsMaya/master/examples/example_preset1.png)
The first preset uses this L-System:
* Axiom: `F`
* Rules: `F --> F[&+F]F[->FL][&FB]`
* Depth: 5
* Angle: 28°

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docwhite/LSystemsMaya/master/examples/example_preset2.png)
This is a Stochastic L-System example, it's the second preset. I created it by myself, it looks good, I must have been so lucky. As they are Stochastic you can generate a few plants and stick with the one you like most. Use the Outliner and pick the plant group to move the entire geometry, it's more comfortable. The L-System:
* Axiom: `F`
* Rules: **70%** `F --> F[+FL][-FB][&FL][^FB]F`, **30%** `F -- > [-FL]F[F[-FB-&&>F][&>F]]`
* Depth: **3**
* Angle: **25.7°**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docwhite/LSystemsMaya/master/examples/example_preset3.png)
Again another Stochastic L-System preset. In perspective view looks a little bit 2D, but still nice. Tim Burton might love these kind of vegetation.
* Axiom: `S`
* Rules: 33% `S --> S[>>&&FL][>>^^FL]S`, 33% `S -- > S[-FL]F[S[-F-FB-&&>S][&>F][+S]]`, 34% `S --> S[+S[-FB][&>S]]`
* Depth: **6**
* Angle: **26.5°**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docwhite/LSystemsMaya/master/examples/example_sierpinski.png)
Fractal geometry is so beautiful. With this script you can also create them. They can be generated in many ways, and the L-System approach is one of them, our script is valid for it as well. For the Sierpinsky just enter:
* Axiom: `F`
* Rules: `F --> X-F-X` and `X --> F+X+F` (We need no percentages because they don't apply to the same predecessor)
* Depth: **6**
* Angle: **60°**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docwhite/LSystemsMaya/master/examples/example_gosper.png)
The Gosper curve is quite famous as well. It's L-System is:
* Axiom: `F`
* Rules: `F --> F+R++R-F--FF-R+` and `R --> -F+RR++R+F--F-R`
* Depth: **5**
* Angle: **60°**

It's normal if you didn't understand exactly what I explained in this readme file, I would recommend you to find a proper explanation of the L-System concept, because it is so interesting! You can even apply L-Systems to music!
